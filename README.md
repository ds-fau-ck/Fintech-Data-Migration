# Fintech Data Migration Project 

![fintech!](FintechDataMigrationPipeline.png)

In this project, we have a SQL Server, and within the SQL Server, we have a schema called "Fintech." Inside this schema, there are five tables: **Customers**, **Accounts**, **Loans**, **Payments**, and **Transactions**. The database follows a simple relational model called Fintech.

We are migrating this database and building a **Lakehouse architecture** with three layers: **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold**. The tables generated by the Gold layer are organized into **fact** and **dimension** tables, enabling the creation of external Synapse tables or ad-hoc processing on top of them.

**Step 2:** We are setting up a Synapse pipeline in the Azure. In this pipeline, we use the **Lookup activity**, which runs SQL queries. For example, it runs a query to select and list all of the tables.

**Step 3:** We use **ADLS** (Azure Data Lake Storage). In ADLS, we have a container named **Fintech**. Inside this container, there are three layers: **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold**.

In the **Lakehouse architecture**:
- **Bronze layer**: Stores the raw data as it is.
- **Silver layer**: Contains data after quality checks and transformation.
- **Gold layer**: Holds the final processed data, which could be aggregated or transformed.
